## Proposed RPG & Leveling Overhaul

This section proposes deep RPG progression systems designed to give each position a unique developmental path. These features move beyond simple attribute increases, offering **Unlockable Mechanics** and **Specialization Trees**.

### 1. Offensive Positions

| Position | Feature Name | Mechanism | XP Cost / Requirement | Positional Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Quarterback** | `Film Study Master` | **Unlockable Ability**: Reveals one defensive coverage shell (Man/Zone) pre-snap after standing in the pocket for 2 seconds. | Level 10 + 5000 XP | Drastically increases pre-snap read accuracy, reducing interceptions. |

| **Running Back** | `Bell Cow Certification` | **Badge**: Increases injury resistance and stamina recovery rate during the 4th quarter. | 200 Carries in a single season | Essential for "Power Back" builds to remain effective in "Close Out" scenarios. |
| **Wide Receiver** | `Route Artist` | **Skill Tree**: Unlocks "Elite" animations for specific cuts (e.g., Whip Route, Comeback) that create instant separation. | Level 5 per route type | Turns average speed receivers into reliable targets through technical perfection. |
| **Wide Receiver** | `Security Blanket` | **Relationship Mechanic**: Catch rate increases by 10% on 3rd downs if the throwing QB has >80 Chemistry. | 3 Seasons with same QB | Encourages keeping QB-WR duos together for long-term dynasty benefits. |
| **Tight End** | `Seam Buster` | **Active Ability**: Bonus speed for 2 seconds when releasing vertically up the hash marks. | Level 12 + Speed > 80 | Forces defenses to respect the TE as a vertical threat, opening up underneath routes. |
| **Tight End** | `Sixth Lineman` | **Stance Toggle**: Can toggle between a "Receiver Stance" (Agility bonus) and "Blocking Stance" (Strength bonus) pre-snap. | Level 5 | Adds tactical depth; allows the TE to dynamically adjust to the defensive front. |
| **Offensive Tackle** | `Island Survivor` | **Mastery**: Negates the "Pass Rush Move" bonus of edge rushers when in 1-on-1 isolation (no TE help). | Level 20 + Pass Block > 90 | Allows the offense to slide protection *away* from this tackle, helping the rest of the line. |
| **Offensive Tackle** | `Technique Doctor` | **Mentorship**: Grants a passive +5 Pass Block bonus to the adjacent Guard. | Level 10 Veteran (>30yo) | Makes veteran tackles valuable mentors for rookie guards. |
| **Offensive Guard** | `Pull Train` | **Physics Modifier**: Increases impact force by 20% when hitting a defender while moving (pulling). | Level 8 + Strength > 85 | Critical for "Power Run" schemes; turns the Guard into a lead blocker weapon. |
| **Offensive Guard** | `Pocket Anchor` | **Stance Upgrade**: Cannot be pushed back more than 1 yard by a Bull Rush, ensuring pocket integrity. | Level 12 | Prevents the QB from being unable to step up, countering high-strength DTs. |
| **Center** | `Line General` | **Pre-Snap Ability**: Can identify the "Mike" LB to reset blocking assignments for the whole line. | Level 15 + Awareness > 90 | Nullifies defensive blitz confusion; acts as a direct counter to "Coverage Disguise". |

### 2. Defensive Positions

| **Defensive Tackle** | `Grave Digger` | **Physics Modifier**: Increases the "Pile Up" radius on tackles, effectively clogging two gaps at once. | Level 12 + Weight > 320lbs | Essential for 3-4 Nose Tackles; frees up LBs to roam freely. |
| **Defensive Tackle** | `Interior Disruptor` | **Passive**: 15% chance to instantly shed a block if the QB steps up into the pocket. | Level 15 | Punishes QBs for holding the ball too long; creates interior pressure. |
| **Linebacker** | `Field Commander` | **Vision Cone**: Expands the "Fog of War" reveal radius for the entire defense. | Level 18 + Awareness > 95 | The defensive equivalent of a QB; ensures the team is never surprised by formations. |
| **Linebacker** | `Lurker` | **Jump Mechanic**: Allows for "Super Jumps" to intercept passes meant for players 5-10 yards behind them. | Level 10 + Jump > 90 | Shuts down the intermediate middle of the field; terrifies QBs throwing slants/posts. |
| **Cornerback** | `Island King` | **Isolation Bonus**: Stats increase by +5 when no Safety help is visible on their side of the field. | Level 20 + Man Cov > 95 | Allows the coordinator to blitz heavily, trusting this corner to win 1-on-1. |

| **Safety** | `Hit Stick Master` | **Physics Event**: Tackles have a 20% higher chance to cause an incompletion (jarring ball loose) upon impact. | Level 8 + Hit Power > 90 | Makes going over the middle dangerous; turns completions into drops. |

### 3. Special Teams Positions

| **Kicker** | `Clutch Kicker` | **Meter Modifier**: The "Accuracy Zone" on the kick meter does not shrink in the 4th quarter or OT. | Level 10 + "Ice in Veins" | Makes game-winning kicks purely skill-based rather than RNG-punishing. |
